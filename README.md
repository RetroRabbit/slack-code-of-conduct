# Retro Rabbit Slack - Code of Conduct

## TL;DR

* Be respectful of others
* Do not harass others
* Do not share personal information of others to people outside the community
* All content shared in public channels must be "safe for work"
* #general is for announcements. To reply to posts on general, please use threads
* Your username should be your full name 

## Channel Etiquette

* Keep on topic to the channel purpose
* Be very considerate about using @channel announcements. Keep in mind that people on leave or offline will receive these notifications.
* Rather use @here when you only want to notify those who are currently online
* Everyone can see everything posted in #general, and like hotel california, no-one can leave, so use it for announcements only. Threads should be used to reply to those announcements.
* For busy channels which may have multiple discussions going on, please use threads as far as possible. 

## Slack Naming Convention

* In order to facilitate finding people's profiles, all slack users should have a @username that contains their name and surname.

## Acceptable Content
It expected that the content made available by employees of Retro Rabbit should at all times adhere to the acceptable content policy. This policy is intended to protect the company's image, as well as the image of its employees, through restrictions on certain classes of content which may be deemed to be unsuitable in a work context.

Classes of content which we deem to be unsuitable include:

 - Pornographic or sexually suggestive material, either in graphic or text form.
 - Depictions of physical or emotional abuse, either in graphic or text form.
 - Persecution of any individual as a result of their race, gender, religion or other physical traits.
 - Material intended to, without basis, harm the reputation of any individual whether a member or not.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Retro Rabbit will persue disciplinary action.

Intentionally evading exclusion, restrictions, or otherwise interfering with the Retro Rabbit team's decisions and actions are not permitted.
